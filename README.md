# Burger

This burger app is a node express application, using MySQL database and handlebars to serve the HTML page.

The app allows users to submit a burger name which will then display on the left-side of the web page in the column "Burgers Waiting to be Devoured".

Each burger that has not been devoured will also have a button called "Devour", so when the user clicks this, the burger will move to the right hand side of the web page under the column "Burgers Devoured".

The user also has the ability to move each burger in the "Burgers Devour" column back to the "Burgers Waiting to be Devoured" column, as the devoured burgers have a "Not Devoured" button in case it was accidently clicked.

Each burger is stored in the MySql database, whether the burger has been devoured or not.
